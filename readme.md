🩵 PHASE 1 — Core MVP Backend (Functional REST API)
Goal: Get the backend running with clean REST endpoints, auth, invoices, and database models.

What you’ll have by end:

NestJS backend + PostgreSQL + Prisma working
REST APIs for Auth, Users, Invoices, and ValueLinks
Tested via Postman
Clean, modular code ready for integration
Modules:

AuthModule (JWT-based)
UsersModule
InvoicesModule
ValueLinkModule
Outcome: 💡 “A centralized prototype that simulates ChainBill + KeyLink logic, all off-chain.”

💰 PHASE 2 — Payments Integration (Stripe + Escrow Simulation)
Goal: Connect real fiat flow for proof of value transfer.

What you’ll add:

PaymentsModule — Stripe integration
Escrow simulation in DB (no blockchain yet)
Webhooks (/webhooks/stripe) for payment updates
Basic status flow: DRAFT → PAID → RELEASED
Outcome: 💳 Users can pay invoices via Stripe → status changes → simulate escrow release.

🔗 PHASE 3 — Blockchain Layer (Aptos / Move contracts)
Goal: Add true decentralized elements.

What you’ll add:

BlockchainModule (Aptos SDK)
Move contract for Escrow (Escrow.move)
Invoice NFT minting
Reputation SBT (SoulBound Token)
Wallet authentication via Aptos signature
Outcome: 🔐 You’ll be able to see invoices minted as NFTs and payments represented as on-chain transactions.

🧠 PHASE 4 — AI Integration (Validation + Summaries)
Goal: Add AI-powered intelligence for invoices.

What you’ll add:

AIModule (OpenAI / LangChain integration)
Invoice text parser
AI validation endpoint /invoices/:id/validate
AI anomaly detector & summary generator
Outcome: 🤖 “AI validates your invoice and suggests due dates or flags inconsistencies.”
🧠 PHASE 4 — AI Integration (Validation + Summaries)
Goal: Add AI-powered intelligence for invoices.

What you’ll add:

AIModule (OpenAI / LangChain integration)
Invoice text parser
AI validation endpoint /invoices/:id/validate
AI anomaly detector & summary generator
Outcome: 🤖 “AI validates your invoice and suggests due dates or flags inconsistencies.”

🔒 PHASE 5 — Privacy & File Storage (IPFS + Encryption)
Goal: Store invoices and deliverables in decentralized storage.

What you’ll add:

StorageModule (Pinata/IPFS SDK)
AES encryption for sensitive files
Metadata hash verification
Outcome: 📁 Invoice PDFs and deliverables stored in IPFS, verified via hash on-chain.

⚖️ PHASE 6 — Dispute Resolution + Reputation System
Goal: Implement decentralized justice + trust.

What you’ll add:

DisputeModule (DAO-like voting system)
ReputationModule (reputation scoring algorithm)
Juror system (mini DAO)
Reputation updates reflected on SoulBound NFT
Outcome: 🧑‍⚖️ Freelancers and clients can raise disputes → jurors vote → trust scores update on-chain.

🌐 PHASE 7 — API Gateway + Real-time Updates
Goal: Bring the platform closer to production quality.

What you’ll add:

WebsocketModule or GraphQL Subscriptions for real-time updates
API Gateway / role-based guards
Background workers (BullMQ + Redis)
Outcome: 🚀 Real-time dashboard, transaction updates, and scalable architecture.

🎨 PHASE 8 — Integration with Frontend (Next.js)
Goal: Connect backend to a slick UI.

What you’ll add:

CORS config + JWT integration
API endpoints consumed by Next.js pages
Demo-ready dashboard for judges/users
Outcome: 🖥️ A functional end-to-end system where users can create invoices, pay, and build trust.

🧩 PHASE 9 — Advanced Add-ons (Stretch Goals)
Optional, but great for hackathon or investor demo:

zk-Proof mock (privacy-preserving verification)
AI-powered trust score
DAO governance dashboard
Chainlink oracle integrations

✅ Suggested path: Start with Phase 1 (Core MVP) right now → build, test, and learn by doing. Once it’s solid, we’ll expand into Phase 2 (Payments) and Phase 3 (Blockchain).

Would you like me to now break down Phase 1 (Core MVP) into its sub-steps and start with the exact commands, folder structure, and teaching flow? ", no results
